// Only created when Loader was about to be used in the app..

/* Here, we extend AsyncTaskLoader and specify List as the generic parameter, which explains what type of data is expected to be loaded.
In this case, the loader is loading a list of Earthquake objects.
Then we take a String URL in the constructor, and in loadInBackground(), we'll do the exact same operations as in doInBackground back in EarthquakeAsyncTask.
Important: Notice that we also override the onStartLoading() method to call forceLoad() which is a required step to actually trigger the loadInBackground() method to execute.
